\section{Introduction}
\label{ch:approach:intro}
For the creation of this thesis work it was necessary to have a deep understanding of Blockchain Systems, distributed computation, \ac{DFS}s, to study different consensus mechanisms and implementation of custom smart contracts able to extend the standards already available. All these technologies and the application of \emph{Full Stack}\footnote{\input{Footnotes/Fullstack}} technologies
create what is known today as the \emph{Web 3.0}\footnote{\input{Footnotes/Web30}}.
