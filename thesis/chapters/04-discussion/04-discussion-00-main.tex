\chapter{Discussion}
\label{ch:discussion}
The implementation of digital asset management through issuance of \ac{NFT}s represents a milestone in the generation of decentralized secure frameworks for industrial applications.

The implicit security of Blockchain with Hyperledger management and the privacy such technology offers will allow different organizations to participate and cooperate securely, but not anonymously. 

All parties will be able to acknowledge data ownership. If desired, data could be encrypted as well and managed trough additional smart contracts. In addition to this, \ac{IPFS} network is able to control, distribute and manage the added data as a \ac{DFS}. The final simulation of the environment allows testers, to acknowledge the workflow of the framework and further expand its capabilities in a modular way.

\section{Results}
The results of the built application indicate that it is potentially feasible to create decentralized systems specialized in data management and control for industrial purposes.
