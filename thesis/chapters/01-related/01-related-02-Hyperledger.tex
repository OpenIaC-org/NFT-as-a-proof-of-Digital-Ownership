\section{Hyperledger Fabric}
\emph{Hyperledger Fabric} is an open source Framework supported by the Hyperledger foundation\footnote{
\emph{Hyperledger Foundation}\cite{HyperledgerFoundation:online} is a non profit organization that brings together all the necessary resources and infrastructure to ensure thriving and stable ecosystems around open source software blockchain projects.} created to implement permissioned distributed ledger platforms for industrial applications. It offers modularity and versatility  for many enterprise projects requiring distributed trustless systems where many parties can interact by joining private channels where a ledger can execute smart contracts and adapt to the business rules without compromising their corporate business security\cite{HyperledgerFabric:online}.
Unlike public Blockchains, \emph{Hyperledger Fabric} uses different services to authorize access to the infrastructure through private channels where specific smart contract rules can be transacted to simply query the ledger or perform operations over stored data.
