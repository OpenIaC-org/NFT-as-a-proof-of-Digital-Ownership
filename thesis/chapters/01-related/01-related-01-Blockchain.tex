Bitcoin whitepaper, where it exposes for the first time "A peer-to-peer version of electronic cash"\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}, by elimination the double spend problem in decentralized systems. It proposes an unbreakable system where any user with a computer can participate by just joining the network. It provides reliability and trustless system through the usage of asynchronous encryption, hashing algorithms, elliptic curves for random password generation, \emph{ Merkle trees}\footnote{\input{Footnotes/MerkleTree}} and the concept of "blocks" which are portions of data with fixed size recording the ledger. The system compensates computers who keep the system secure by solving a complex mathematical problem \ac{PoW}. Bitcoin brings security by democratizing access to all its participants without a central authority and with the generation of value-appreciation.
