\section{Objectives}
The present work will demonstrate the functionality and potential of a digital asset management system via Blockchain and \ac{NFT} smart contract with \ac{IPFS} as a data storage repository.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a permissioned system blockchain with the ability to store Digital Assets through the use and extension of the \ac{ERC}-721 protocol and expand its potential for file storage, data sharing and distribution.
    \item Use the protocol \ac{IPFS} to store data and link its address in the blockchain
    \item Implement a consensus mechanism that incentivize cooperation and participation of different parties with the purpose to share, trust, compose and improve data structures and third party systems by implementing a \ac{DLT}.
    \item Provide a baseline platform to allow the usage of \ac{NFT} and promote mutual trust the system
    \item Expose alternative consensus mechanisms to extend the application of the system in other industries.
    \item Create a system able to represent ownership of certain digital assets through the emission of \ac{NFT}
\item Propose a system to transfer such \ac{NFT}S between institutions as the equivalent of ownership transfer
\item Link the ownership system with the identity and blockchain databases.
\item Demonstrate that proposed functionality could enable institutions and corporations easy ways to cooperate and compute datasets by using ownership mechanisms
\end{itemize}
