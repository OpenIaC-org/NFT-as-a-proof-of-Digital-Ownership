\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{ch:intro:sec:motivation}
% In the digital era  and with the arrival of cloud computing, 
As digital era keeps evolving and cloud computing increases its power, users and companies are no longer in full control of their resources, rather than that, they led third party companies to store their information without fully knowing the way or locations it could be. In addition to this, recent cyber security risks and the progress of malware, ransomware and other harmful technologies have put the whole world into a cyber crisis. Ever since the creation of the interned such cyber attacks have been increasing exponentially and represent risks for the assets of the companies, countries and end users. Data is vital, data keeps breaching and leaking sometimes without event noticing but months after the damage has happened. 

This brings the need for an implementation of a more secure way to store and manage data through the internet without suffering from the present security risks.

Decentralized systems and Blockchain technologies created in the last ten years offer a tremendous potential to bring organization into a new way to manage their virtual assets. 

It is therefore the purpose of this thesis project to create an architecture and functional system to record unique ownership of digital assets in a permissioned blockchain (datasets ownership) while providing the infrastructure to allow its usage or deny it depending on the agreements of the system through the issuance of NFT's and smart contracts as an alternative solution that allows to alleviate the present cyber security risks while enabling data management securely and privately.
