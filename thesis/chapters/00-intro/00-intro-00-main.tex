As Blockchain technologies attract the interest of worldwide industries for its intrinsic values, new possibilities unleash to promote mutual cooperation in benefit of building up and improving technologies securely and manageable. Companies can benefit from such systems when through inter-organizational trust, privacy and protection; improving and protecting businesses while cooperating and sharing information through a common system. 

When it comes to large-volume data sharing and storage, it becomes vital to verify its authenticity and avoid plagiarism/counterfeiting. This thesis project proposes a system for the treatment of data as a digital asset through the concept of smart contracts to manage Non-fungibility in a Blockchain system, and a server/application infrastructure to expose the potential and possibilities that data ownership can have when it is brought into decentralized permissioned systems with Hyperledger Fabric as a Blockchain system and  \ac{IPFS} as a \ac{DFS} system.
